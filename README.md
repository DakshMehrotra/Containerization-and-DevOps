# Containerization and DevOps Lab Repository

Welcome to my **Containerization and DevOps** laboratory repository.

This repository contains all my **college-related coursework, lab experiments, practical implementations, class activities, documentation, and notes** for the subject **Containerization and DevOps**.

The main objective of this repository is to develop a strong understanding of how modern software applications are:

- Built and deployed efficiently  
- Containerized using Docker  
- Automated through DevOps workflows  
- Managed using industry-standard tools and practices  

This repository is maintained strictly for **academic submission and learning purposes**.
