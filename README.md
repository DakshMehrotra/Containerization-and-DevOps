# Containerization and DevOps Lab Repository

Welcome to my Containerization and DevOps repository.

This repository contains all my college lab work, practical experiments, class activities, documentation, and notes related to the subject. The main purpose of this repository is to gain hands-on experience and strong understanding of how modern applications are built, containerized, automated, deployed, and managed using DevOps practices.

## Experiments

- [Experiment 1 — Virtual Machines vs Containers](https://github.com/DakshMehrotra/Containerization-and-DevOps/blob/main/Lab%20Work/Experiment1/README.md)
- A DevOps-oriented comparison between Virtual Machines and Containers using Ubuntu, VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker, and Nginx. Demonstrates infrastructure provisioning, VM-based service deployment, containerized application execution, and architectural differences in resource usage and isolation.

- [Experiment 2 — Docker Installation & Container Lifecycle](https://github.com/DakshMehrotra/Containerization-and-DevOps/blob/main/Lab%20Work/Experiment%202/README.md)
- Covers Docker fundamentals including image pulling, container execution with port mapping, service verification, port conflict handling, and full container lifecycle management reflecting real-world container deployment workflows.
