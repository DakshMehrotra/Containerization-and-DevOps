#  Experiment 1: VM vs Containers using Ubuntu & Nginx

##  Objective
The objective of this experiment is to understand, implement, and compare:
- Virtual Machines using VirtualBox and Vagrant
- Containers using Docker
by deploying an Nginx web server in both environments and observing resource utilization.

---

## 🖥️ System Requirements
### Hardware
- 64-bit system with virtualization enabled
- Minimum 4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended)
- Internet connection

### Software
- Windows OS
- Oracle VirtualBox
- Vagrant
- Ubuntu (Vagrant box)
- Docker Engine

---

## 🧩 Part A: Virtual Machine Setup using Vagrant

### 🔹 Step 1: Verify Vagrant Installation
```
vagrant --version
```

### 🔹 Step 2: Create Project Directory
```
mkdir vm-lab
cd vm-lab
```

### 🔹 Step 3: Initialize Vagrant with Ubuntu Box
```
vagrant init ubuntu/jammy64
```

### 🔹 Step 4: Start the Virtual Machine
```
vagrant up
```

### 🔹 Step 5: Access the VM via SSH
```
vagrant ssh
```

---

## 🌐 Install Nginx inside VM
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

### 🔹 Verify Nginx
```
curl localhost
```

---

## 📊 Resource Observation (VM)
```
free -h
htop
systemd-analyze
```

---

## 🧩 Part B: Container Setup using Docker (inside VM)

### 🔹 Step 1: Install Docker
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -aG docker vagrant
```

Re-login to apply permissions:
```
exit
vagrant ssh
```

### 🔹 Verify Docker
```
docker --version
```

---

## 🌐 Run Nginx Container
```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name nginx-container nginx
```

### 🔹 Verify Nginx Container
```
curl localhost:8080
```

---

## 📊 Resource Observation (Container)
```
docker stats
free -h
```

---

## 🧹 Cleanup Commands
```
docker stop nginx-container
docker rm nginx-container
exit
vagrant halt
```

---

## 📈 Comparison Summary

| Parameter | Virtual Machine | Container |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Boot Time | High | Very Low |
| RAM Usage | High | Low |
| CPU Overhead | Higher | Minimal |
| Disk Usage | Larger | Smaller |
| Isolation | Strong | Moderate |

---

## ✅ Result
This experiment demonstrates that containers are significantly more lightweight and resource-efficient compared to virtual machines. While virtual machines provide stronger isolation and a complete OS-level abstraction, containers are faster, more scalable, and better suited for modern DevOps workflows.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
Virtual Machines and Containers both have their place in modern infrastructure. However, containers are preferred in cloud-native and DevOps environments due to their speed, efficiency, and portability.
